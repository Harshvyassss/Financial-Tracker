# Personal Finance Tracker

A clean and simple web app to track your income, expenses, and spending habits — built using Python, Django , and SQL.

# About the Project

I created this project as a way to combine my interest in web development with something practical managing personal finances.

It started as a basic Django app, but as I kept learning, I added new features — like user authentication, categorized transactions, and a dashboard view. 
Every part of this project helped me get more comfortable with Django’s models, views, and templates, as well as SQL logic behind the scenes.

# Built With

- Python – backend logic
- Django – full-stack web framework
- SQLite– development database 
- HTML/CSS – for templates and layout
- Bootstrap – for styling (optional)

# Features

- User authentication (login/logout)
- Add/Edit/Delete income and expenses
- Categorize transactions
- Dashboard with latest transactions
- Monthly and category-wise views (to be added)

# What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) structure
- SQL and ORM relationships
- Handling forms, sessions, and user input
- Project structure and scaling a Django app

# Future Improvements

- Graphs and charts for financial insights
- Budget setting and alerts
- REST API integration
- Responsive mobile-first design
